          <p>
            During our ziriguidum meetings, we will play songs, read lyrics with
            English translations, and sometimes watch music videos or live
            performances. I also share historical context, artistic background,
            and little anecdotes along the way, making each session engaging and
            immersive.

            This time, <strong>in February 2026,</strong> I’m hosting two
            evening groups:{" "}
            <strong>
              one online (CET, Central European Time) on Mondays, and another
              one at my home in Berlin (Neukölln), on Tuesdays
            </strong>
            .
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The online group will start on Monday, February 2nd, at 18.30, and
              its last meeting will be on February 23rd, same time.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Berlin group will start on Tuesday, February 3rd, at 18.30,
              and its last meeting will be on February 24th, same time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To keep our sessions personal and interactive,{" "}
            <strong>each group will have no more than 10 participants.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The mini-course is divided into{" "}
            <strong>four one-hour sessions</strong> (sometimes a few minutes
            longer), each dedicated to a single genre. The first three cover
            samba, bossa nova, and forró, while the final session brings
            together a variety of rhythms such as MPB, Brazilian rock, pop, and
            more.
          </p>
          <p className="margin-bottom-0 padding-bottom-2xs">
            By the end of the course, you’ll have a solid foundation; enough to
            keep exploring Brazilian music on your own.{" "}
            <strong>
              Each session also comes with a curated playlist to accompany what
              we discuss.
