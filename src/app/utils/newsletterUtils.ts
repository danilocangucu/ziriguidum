    artist: "Elza Soares",
    description:
      "I love Elza. She’s one of those Brazilian artists I really miss. She passed away in 2022 at 91, leaving a career of over 60 years. Her songs travel from samba to experimental rock, and it’s almost impossible to pick just one. Still, this track felt just right for the first Ziriguidum of the day.",

    artist: "Gilberto Gil",
    description: `A Brazilian mantra of faith, hope and perseverance. "Andar com fé" ("Walking with Faith") certainly is one of Gilberto Gil's most iconic songs. Released in 1982, the song also reflects Brazil’s final years under military rule. This seemingly simple song has taught me a lot about resilience and hope. It made it clear to me, for example, that faith isn’t tied to any belief system; it’s a personal attitude towards life.`,

    artist: "Caetano Veloso",
    description: `If this wasn't the most listened song in Brazil in 1999, for sure it was the second. Written by Peninha, "Sozinho" ("Alone") was a massive hit for Caetano, who included it in his live album "Prenda Minha". This album sold over 1 million copies in Brazil alone. The track is a heartfelt ballad about solitude and longing and became one of Caetano's signature songs.`,
