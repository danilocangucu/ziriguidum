    description:
      "I love Elza. She’s one of those Brazilian artists I really miss. She passed away in 2022 at 91, leaving a career of over 60 years. Her songs travel from samba to experimental rock, and it’s almost impossible to pick just one. Still, this track felt just right for the first Ziriguidum of the day.",

        "Do you want to know what ziriguidum is?\nZiriguidum is indeed a thing!\nThat is only made with pandeiro and tamborim",
